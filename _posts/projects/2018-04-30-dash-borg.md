# Web Bluetooth Controller for Dash Robotics

{:.image}
![Alt text](assets/img/dashBorg/dash_team.JPG "My Title")

For our capstone project, my capstone team and I were tasked to create a web application,
leveraging chrome's new web bluetooth api, that could interface with Dash Robotics,
a robotic's company, bug-like bots. The main goal of the application was to create
a fun and educational experience for children looking to learn about programming.

The main goals for this project were:
* A free-drive controller page, where the user can freely control the bot via the web app.
* A GUI scripting page, where kids could visually program commands that the bot could perform.

# Free Drive Mode

We created a free-drive controller that allowed users to control the bot via a
wasd, or joystick interface. Along with movement, we added a power slider, color
customization, and dance commands.

# GUI Scripting Mode

The GUI scripting page allows users to create a series of actions for the bot to perform.
Users can navigate through a selection of blocks and then drag them onto a workspace to be executed.

This mode provided the most technical challenges. We had to create custom blocks that translated to
a promise-based running architecture, allowing for asynchronous bluetooth commands to be performed
while maintaining order in the program.

The team and I had a blast while working on this project. We were able to ride the line
between web and embedded applications. We were also able to create something that's one of the first of its kind.
Our success relied heavily on utilizing open-source libraries and developer tools that allowed
us to focus purely on application specific problems.

# Tools Used
In order to focus mostly on how kids would interact with our application, we utilized tools throughout
our project. The most useful tools we used were:
* **Chrome Web BLE** - A new API in chrome, that allows for users to connect and interact with bluetooth devices through a browser.
* **Blockly** - A visual programming library created by Google that allows for connective blocks to be composed and translated into a executable program.
* **VueJS** - A frontend framework that allowed for easy making of a Single-Page-Application.

<!-- ## Chrome Web Bluetooth
Chrome’s Web-Based Bluetooth uses Bluetooth GATT (BLE 4.0 low energy). From a very conceptual point of view, their API works similar to regular Bluetooth. You have a Device, that device has Services, within those services are Characteristics and you can send and receive Notifications to/from.

As far as code goes, below is an introductory example of connecting to a device using the navigator.bluetooth object, and filtering on a specific service name.

{% highlight javascript %}
navigator.bluetooth.requestDevice()
	Filters:[{
		Services:[‘battery_services’]
	}]
})
{% endhighlight %}

Google’s Web-BLE is a promised based API. So once the user pairs with a device, it will resolve a promise and we get a device object that has basic information, such as the name and advertised services of that device. Because the API is promise based, we can chain commands together using a repeating *.then({...})* keyword
to create the asynchronous yet ordered operations:
* Find the device
* *then* connect to the device
* *then* find a service on the device
* *then* find a characteristic on that service
* *then* read/write the value of that characteristic

That translated to web bluetooth api code looks like the following,

{% highlight javascript %}
navigator.bluetooth.requestDevice()
	Filters:[{
		Services:[‘battery_services’]
	}]
})
.then(device => {
	return device.connectGATT();
})
.then(gattServer => gattServer.getPrimaryService(‘battery_services’))
.then(service => service.getCharacteristic(‘battery_level’))
.then(characteristic => characteristic.readValue())
.then(buffer => {
	let batteryLevel = buffer.getUint8(0);
	console.log(“ The Battery Level is ” + batteryLevel + “%”);
})
{% endhighlight %}

This general structure is great, but it requires the user to connect to the device before every
read/write. To allow for a single connection in the app, we did one scan on all services/characteristics the bot
has and saved a reference to those services/characteristics to user throughout our application.
