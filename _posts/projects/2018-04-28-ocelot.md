# Ocelot Programming Language

{:.image}
![Alt text](assets/img/ocelot.jpg "My Title")

In a recent class, a team of me and 3 other students needed to make our own
programming language. This project gave us all a great idea of the challenges
that are faced when designing a language in grammar, parsing, and evaluating.

The language can perform:
* boolean expressions
* arithmetic expressions
* conditional (if/else) operations
* while loops
* function declarations and calls
* receive command line arguments
* print identifiers, and string literals

The entire pipeline from tokenization to evaluation was written entirely in SWI Prolog.
Prolog was the perfect tool for this task because grammars can easily be converted into
DCGs in Prolog, and the evaluation of operations can be easily adapted out from the
DCG.

## Example Programs

### Fibonacci
{% highlight go %}
:O Calculates the fibonacci number for n :|

n = $1.

if n == 0
[
    fibonacci = 0.
]
else if n == 1
[
    fibonacci = 1.
]
else
[
    a = 0.
    b = 1.
    i = 2.

    while i <= n
    [
        fibonacci = a + b.
        a = b.
        b = fibonacci.
        i = i+1.
    ]
]

print fibonacci.
{% endhighlight %}

### Greatest Common Denominator
{% highlight javascript %}
function gcd = [a b] [
    if a == 0 [
        value = b.
    ]
    else if b == 0 [
        value = a.
    ]
    else [
        c = a % b.
        value = call gcd [b c].
    ]

    return value.
]

print call gcd [$1 $2].
{% endhighlight %}
