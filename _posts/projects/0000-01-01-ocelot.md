# Ocelot Programming Language

{:.image}
![Alt text](assets/img/ocelot.jpg "My Title")

In a recent class, a team of me and 3 other students needed to make our own
programming language. This project gave us all a great idea of the challenges
that are faced when designing a language in grammar, parsing, and evaluating.

The language can perform:
* boolean expressions
* arithmetic expressions
* conditional (if/else) operations
* while loops
* functions (coming soon)

The entire pipeline from tokenization to evaluation was written entirely in SWI Prolog.
Prolog was the perfect tool for this task because grammars can easily be converted into
DCGs in Prolog, and the evaluation of operations can be easily adapted out from the
DCG.

_The language is currently under development and I'll be posting the finished product
in a couple of weeks!_

<!-- The following are example programs, and their outputs in this language. -->
