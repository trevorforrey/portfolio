# Custom Fight Stick

![Alt text](assets/img/fs2.jpeg "My Title")

A couple years ago, I got really into Street Fighter: Third Strike. Third Strike
is so stylized, emotional, and fast, that I got hooked playing one summer with
my girlfriend. Playing Third Strike really opened up a new world for me when it
comes to fighting games. With the announcement of Street Fighter V coming around
this time, I delved deeper into the technical side of fighting games.

With my anticipation for the game at an all-time high, I decided to make a custom
PS4 fight stick. Here are some pictures of the process and the final result.

Throughout this project I was able to learn a lot about prototyping tools. It was
also nice being able to do some graphic design for the collage on the face of
the stick. When I made this I was pretty crazy about Street Fighter and I'm glad
I was able to learn something and be productive through my excitement of the series.
