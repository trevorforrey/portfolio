# Custom Fight Stick

A couple years ago, I got really into Street Fighter: Third Strike. Third Strike
is so stylized, emotional, and fast, that I got hooked playing one summer with
my girlfriend. Playing Third Strike really opened up a new world for me when it
comes to fighting games. With the announcement of Street Fighter V coming around
this time, I delved deeper into the technical side of fighting games.

With my anticipation for the game at an all-time high, I decided to make a custom
PS4 fight stick. Here are some pictures of the process and the final result.
