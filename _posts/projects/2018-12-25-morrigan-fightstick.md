My fianc√© and I really enjoy playing fighting games together, but she didn't
have a high quality fightstick to play on. For Christmas I wanted to make her a custom fightstick based on her favorite capcom character, Morrigan. Below are the specs along with some images of the creation of the stick.

inside of the top of the box.
