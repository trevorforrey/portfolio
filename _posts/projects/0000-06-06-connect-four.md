# Connect Four {% include icon-github.html username='trevorforrey' git-url='ConnectFour' %}

This was one of the first big team software project I worked on in school. Our
goal was to create a game in Java based off of the table-top game Connect Four.

My largest contribution to the game was creating the computer AI, and the different
stages of difficultly within that AI. This was done by looking at the current state
of the board and finding possible scoring patterns. By looking at these patterns the
AI was able to score the effectiveness of each move and make a meaningful choice.
