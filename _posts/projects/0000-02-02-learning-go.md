# Learning Go Through Illustrations

{:.image}
![Alt text](assets/img/goherIllustration.png "My Title")

_Learning Go Through Illustrations_ is a Medium article I wrote to help solidify
my understanding of Go's concurrency primitives. It also gave me an excuse to draw
a bunch of Go Gophers!

If you want to learn about Go, or see some cute gophers, feel free to check it out!

_Article is currently in progress, but should be complete in a couple days!_
