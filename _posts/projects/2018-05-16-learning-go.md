# Learning Go Through Illustrations

![Alt text](assets/img/goherIllustration.png "My Title")

_Learning Go Through Illustrations_ is a Medium article I wrote to help teach

a bunch of Go Gophers!

If you want to learn about Go, or see some cute gophers, feel free to [check it out](https://medium.com/@trevor4e/learning-gos-concurrency-through-illustrations-8c4aff603b3)!
